# you-can-bill
COSC 112 Java Project, Spring 2022

Instructions for use of YouCanBillâ„¢:

Compile the program by navigating to the directory with all code in it and running "javac *.java" from the command line.
Run the program with "java Main".
Start by entering your name and then choosing your preferred payment type.
Once done, choose whether you are paying for the bill by yourself or would like to add more people.
Given your previous choice, either input your receipt (only JPG or JPEG images are allowed) or first add whoever else you would like to join you in paying for the bill.
Once you have the image displayed on your screen, select an item by clicking in one corner of the desired area, holding and dragging your cursor to the opposite corner, then releasing. Do this as many times as needed for the first person. Then, click the button that states "Select Person After Crop" to indicate which person will be paying for those items.
Repeat the previous step for all people paying in your party.
After that, continue on to billing. If there is a credit card user amongst your party you will be prompted to enter their credit card information. Please do not include spaces in the credit card number.
When done, press enter and then press done.
You are done and have access to your individual receipts (as JPG files) for future reference!
